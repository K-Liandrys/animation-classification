# Project: Animated Movie Classification using Deep Learning

This is a repo for this detailed [blog post](http://quantran.xyz/blog/building-an-image-classification-model-from-a-to-z/). Including Grad-CAM visualization Python module ([code](gradcam.py) and [use cases](gradcam-usecase.ipynb)) and notebooks containing training processes and steps. If you want to trace my process, here is the order (for more details you can visit the blog post):
1. [crop-fix.ipynb](crop-fix.ipynb)
2. [google-image-download.ipynb](google-image-download.ipynb)
3. [image-augmentation.ipynb](image-augmentation.ipynb)
4. [resnet-training-with-upsampling.ipynb](resnet-training-with-upsampling.ipynb)
5. [final-training-all-images.ipynb](final-training-all-images.ipynb)
6. [live-action-model-check.ipynb](live-action-model-check.ipynb)

Tools use: [Fastai library which built on top of Pytorch 1.0](https://github.com/fastai/fastai), Matplotlib, scikit-image, [google-images-download](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download)
